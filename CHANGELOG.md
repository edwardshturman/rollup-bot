## 0.3.4 â€” 2022-12-25

Merry Christmas! ðŸŽ„

## Added

- `/roadmap` command: fetches [Issues](https://github.com/edwardshturman/rollup-bot/issues) list and sends embeds
- `/bug` command: report bugs â€” **admins only**, will reject reports from those without **`Manage Server`** permissions

## 0.3.2 â€” 2022-12-24

### Changed

- Purging no longer checks for **`Manage Messages`** perms, as Discord has native command perms for servers
- A lot of boring stuff for code quality

### Removed

- `/ping` command

## 0.3.0 â€”Â 2022-01-02

### Added

- `purge` slash and context commands! ðŸŒŸ
  - Useful for when creating a new thread isn't necessary, and you just want to clean up spam.
  - Use `/purge <messages>` (with a maximum of 100) to delete the specified amount of messages, starting with the most recent.
  - Right-click a message within 100 recent messages in a channel to delete all the messages from there onward.
  - Only available for server members with the `Manage Messages` permission.

## 0.2.1 â€”Â 2021-11-27

### Changed

- Updated the context menu command to better describe what it does
- Added a username for who requests thread creation to the audit log entry
- Rollup now displays how many messages were threaded from a request
- `/rollup` now won't allow a value exceeding 100 messages
- Should either the `/rollup` slash command or context menu command fail, the response will now be ephemeral (only the user requesting threading can see it)

## 0.2.0 â€”Â 2021-11-26

### Added

- Context menu command! ðŸŒŸ
  - Right-click a message within 100 recent messages in a channel to create a new thread from there onward. No more having to specify a number all the time!
